# Paths (general)
# It seems placing the $PATH at the end of the statement (export PATH=/usr/local/git/bin:$PATH)
# assures that the system looks in this custom place **before** searching default places
# (that is, the specified path is appended before the standard places contained within $PATH).
# path goes at the end in the default places, because I want the default places to go first.
